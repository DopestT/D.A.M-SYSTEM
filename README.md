# D.A.M-SYSTEM
DAM System is an open-source "Cognitive Firewall" designed to neutralize "Flood the Zone" media tactics. Using a Python/FastAPI backend and a Chrome extension, it calculates a Distraction Score, strips rhetorical "paint" (hyperbole) in real-time, and surfaces primary sources to help you reclaim your focus from the noise. 🦫🛡️
